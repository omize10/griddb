<h1>B.C Flooding</h1> 
</h1> This year has been one of climate change with the big wildfires and now the flooding. The community has to step up and do something. We can't just sit back and watch people die, and homes getting trashed. 2021 will be a year to remember. But before we can fight climate change, we have to take care of the B.C floods. Once we are done fighting, the BC floods then we can move on to climate change.</h1>

</h1> We need to help because people's homes are getting washed into the river like this is normal. There are houses under water and people need money. All their money was in their houses which are under water. This will be a very costly event. If everyone takes the time to do something small like give someone a little food or donate their old clothes, even if you help fill sandbags. It would help them out a lot. Anything will help in this climate crisis.</h1>

</h1>I think it is not just us that needs to do a lot more the government needs to as well. So far they have only closed down roads, rationed gas, and sent out the military. They should go out and buy clothes and give them to the evacuees to make them comfortable and help them get out of this situation. The government needs to do more!</h1>
